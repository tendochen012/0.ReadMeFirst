# Intro

Hi, welcome to my github.

My name is Yichen but I go by Tendo (like NinTendo!). I am currently at school for applied mathematics and statistics. 

Current coursework:
    Advanced Ordinary Differential Equation
    Elementary Partial Differential Equation
    Multivariate Statistical Analysis

This is just some of my simple coding projects that I was/am working on.

I hope you enjoy!
